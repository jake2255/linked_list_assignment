# student database
This program implements a singly linked list and a binary tree into a student database that stores student information and can perform various different functions. Also compares the difference it takes to traverse and find information between the linked list and binary tree.

The runtime complexity of the Linked List for the insert, delete, search, and update function are as follow:
  1.Insertion runs in linear time O (n)
  2.Delete function runs in linear time O(n)
  3.Searching function runs in linear time O(n)
  4.Update function runs in linear time O(n)
The runtime complexity of the Binary Search Tree averages to O(log n).
  1.Insertion:
  Average case: O (log n)
  Worst case happens when the binary search tree becomes unbalanced: O(n)
  2.Deletion:
  Average case: O (log n)
  Worst case happens when the binary search tree becomes unbalanced: O(n)
  3.Search:
  Average case: O (log n)
  Worst case happens when the binary search tree becomes unbalanced: O(n) 
  4.Update:
  Average case: O(log n)
  Worst case happens when the binary search tree becomes unbalanced: O(n)
Binary search trees are more efficient with deletion, searching and updating functions as they are not in linear time. While Linked list are efficient when inserting at the end of the list. Both Linked list and Binary Search trees can be useful for the insertion or deletion function. The Binary Search Tree depends on the balance of the tree for its time complexity as it can become the same time complexity as a linked list in worst case.
